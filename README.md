## Installation

To install and run this framework, it is recommended that you create a `conda` environment. For further information on managing conda environments, confer 
[the docs](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). 
Afterwards, head over to [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally) and install the appropriate PyTorch and Cuda versions. 

Once PyTorch is installed, go ahead and clone this repository. Then install the required libraries:

`pip install opencv-python` \
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Once everything is set up, you can simply run `python main.py` to load up the application GUI.
